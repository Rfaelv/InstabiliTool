## Tecnology

The InstabiliTool is powered by [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/). The Framework Electron is used in the interface. It was chosen because of your rich features that allow the implementation of automated updates and the development of a modern GUI, aspects considered important. The Python language is used to generate an APDL instance in the background and run in it the model defined in the interface. To do this connection is used the mapdl library. This was the most important lib used and all the others are listed [here](https://github.com/Rfaelv/InstabiliTool/blob/master/package.json).
